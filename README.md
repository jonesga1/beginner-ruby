## Coding Ruby

This is a `variable`. Keep typing.

Variables can be assigned values manually.
```
apples = 10
boxesfull = true
cat = 'meow'
```
Variables can be used for storing values in expressions and also for methods.

In this expression '15' would be returned or displayed.
```
a = 10
b = 5
return a + b
```
Variables can be many things, such as strings, integers, booleans, and arrays.
```
string = 'text'
integer = 2
boolean = false
array = [1, "hi", true]
```

```
def my_method(a)
  a + 10
end
```
